The main advantage of using semaphores in the program keeping track of how many items had been created and currently exist at any given time. The main disadvantage was that my solution required numerous semaphores. When changing the program to use mutexes instead, the main problem I faced was that I couldn't get the the process to create the exact amount specified. I had to resort to using separate counters to keep track of how many items were created and how many are left to make. Mutexes and condition variables did let me to signal to the other threads a lot easier and more intuitively.
